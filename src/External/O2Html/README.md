# O2HTML

O2HTML is a powerful C# library designed to seamlessly serialize any .NET object 
into HTML, providing a straightforward way to represent complex data structures 
visually. It offers the flexibility to generate HTML strings or create an HTML DOM 
object, acting as a lightweight virtual DOM. Effortlessly transform 
your .NET objects into structured, customizable HTML, simplifying the process of 
integrating data into web applications.

This library powers [NetPad](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad).

TODO before publishing a nuget package:
